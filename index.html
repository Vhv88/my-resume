    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Hello everyone! My name is Victor Huidobro Vico, I'm from Barcelona
      (Spain) and I started studying web development together with python as I
      wanted to change the direction of my life. Before this, I've been a real
      estate agent for over 14 years but my brain and mind has always been on
      the technology. I always though u needed a proper career for that but
      nowadays with self-teaching and courses it's much more common to do it
      so.. I take it as my chance now!
